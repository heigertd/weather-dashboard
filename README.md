# weather-dashboard

The weather dashboard is an application that will give you the current weather and the 5 day forcast for any city that you search for. This project helped us with using APIs and pulling information from them. I learned about time management during this assignment as I had to worked on this and group project 1 at the same time. This was definitely the largest issue as pulling information from the APIs and putting it on the screen was not too difficult.
